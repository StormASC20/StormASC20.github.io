    <h1>Storm Rivera, at your service!</h1>
    <p><strong>I know what you're going to say and, pretty sweet name, right? 
        My name isn't the only stand-out thing about me, however!
        I've got a knack for learning, and plenty of experience to boot.
        Even with all of that, I know that I can still learn from those around me.
        Use this website as a point of reference, but know that it isn't all I have to offer!</strong></p>

            <h1>Skillset and Experience</h1>
        <p><strong>Went to Bridge To Enter Advanced Mathematics, or BEAM, for 8 years, 
            starting in 2014. In the summer of 2020, I attended All Star Code, which 
            provides lectures on a multitude of topics, such as game design, and HTML/CSS 
            just to name a couple. It lasted for six weeks.</strong></p>
